		<h3>Sync Engine fme Folder</h3>
		<p>Folder that contains the FME Workbench files and related python scripts</p>
		<p>The .fmw files in this folder are all FME workbench files that define key parts of the Sync Engine processing. 
		These tools read from source CAD or Geodatabase datasets, perform a series of calculations on data, often including the creation 
		of new fields and datasets for the target database. They read source 2D CAD drawings and write to staging and production 3D Geodatabases.
		<p>Each of the FME files imports gseDrawing.py and gzfme.py.</p>
		<p>gseDrawing.py contains the functions that calculate common field values such as SITEID, BUILDINGID, FLOORID, and 
		portions of those values. These settings are unique for each organization, and all of the configuration files use gseDrawing.<function> 
		to construct these values. This is one of the main places where changes are made for a new customer project, and the 
		place that must be changed if the folder/file structure for the source CAD drawings changes, or if other organization-wide changes are made.</p>
		<p>gzfme.py contains functions that are used by python scripts within FME related to the Gizinta configuration files. 
		It also contains some of the logic for shutdown scripts and other common parts of the FME workbench setup.</p>
		<h3>Folders:</h3>
		<p>Customxfmr - Custom transformers that must be installed in the user or system fme transformer folder</p>
		<p>embed - Python stub code to be embedded as startup and shutdown scripts in any new FME processes</p>
		<p>log - Location of log files produced by the system. These files are very useful for debugging purposes</p>
		<p>Utilities - Samples and other tools that are not actively used in normal processing</p>
