		<h3>Sync Engine py Folder</h3>
<p>*** ToDo: document each .py script at a high level</p>		
<p>This folder contains the main python scripts that automate the CAD->GIS processing</p>
		<p>The main script for processing is gseLoaderFME.py. This tool accepts 2 arguments - the playlist to run, and the server config file to be used. 
		The playlist argument can be a single file or a comma-separated list of values. For example, for Floorplan processing, there is 
		a loadplaylist,deriveplaylist argument. gseLoaderFME will run each of the playlists in order, and if everything works it will write 
		data to the production cad sde database. If there are any issues they are logged, no data is written, and the processing will move on to the next drawing.</p>
		<p>The server config file argument is an XML file that contains a number of settings for the processing. This includes the 
		location of the cad files, the sde connection files for the staging and production databases, and other settings.</p>
		<p>More documentation on the playlists and server config files can be found in the documentation for 
		<a href="../config/index.html">config</a> and <a href="../serverConfig/index.html">serverConfig</a> folders.</p>
		<h3>Folders:</h3>
		<p>dwgManagement - scripts to populate the database list of active floors and other utilities developed for specific projects</p>
		<p>log - Location of log files produced by the system. These files are very useful for debugging purposes</p>
