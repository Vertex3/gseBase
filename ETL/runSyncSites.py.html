<p>This process is the main synchronization process that is run on a regular basis as a scheduled task. The process typically starts at the top of each hour and processes and drawings from the CAD Vault mirror that are present since the last update.</p>

<p>Use the sitesCAD.txt file for the list of sites to process</p>
<p>For each site:
        <li>Run bldgLoadPlaylist.xml to load Bldg Outlines</li>
<li>Run fpLoadPlaylist.xml to load floorplans</li>
<li>Run rtLoadPlaylist.xml to load Routing drawings</li>
<li>Run runRoutingExtract.py to extract changed routing drawings by building since this process started</li>
