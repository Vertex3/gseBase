		<p>gse.tbx - contains several geoprocessing tools used to create difference views and analyze datasets</p>
		<p>gseLocal.tbx - some site-specific geoprocessing models that use tools in gse.tbx</p>
		<p>sitesCAD.txt - list of Sites used by the runSyncSites.py script</p>
		<p>sitesNavigation.txt - list of Sites used by the runSyncNavigation.py script</p>
