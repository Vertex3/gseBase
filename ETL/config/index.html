		<h3>Sync Engine config Folder</h3>
		<p>Folder that contains Gizinta xml configuration files</p>
		<p>This folder contains Gizinta playlist files along with subfolders containing the files referenced in the playlists</p>
	<p>A Gizinta plalylist is a list of datasets to be processed, and each of the Sync Engine processing steps uses a playlist argument
		to control the source data that is read, and the target data that is written by the processing step. The playlist file also contains 
		key settings such as the FME workbench process to run, the name of the log file to be created, a filter on file names (i.e., nameContains='XP') 
		and an indication of the source dataset type.</p>
		<p>Each Gizinta file contains the source and target dataset names, along with details for the field mapping and QA/QC processing for
		each dataset. One addition to the Floorplan Sync Engine over typical Gizinta files is that they contain the details 
		for the database views that are used for change detection. This information is stored in the ChangeDetection elements in the XML documents.</p>
